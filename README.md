# CSS-climbingCube

Fun with CSS animations - hover over the cube to see what happens! 

During this project I learned about -webkit. Webkit is the HTML/CSS rendering engine used by Chrome and Safari. There are loads of Webkit only properties in CSS, one of which I've used here to make the cube reflect on the platform.

A full list of Webkit CSS properties can be found [here.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/WebKit_Extensions)
